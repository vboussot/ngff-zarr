"""Bridge ITK displacement fields and RFC-5 ``displacements`` transformations.

A displacement field is a transformation and an array at once. ITK keeps the
array inside the transform, as a vector image with its own grid; RFC-5 keeps it
in the store, as a multiscale image the ``displacements`` entry points at by
``path``. So the two conversions here are the only ones in this package whose
result has two parts, and they stay pure: nothing is read from or written to a
store. The caller writes the field next to its image, and loads it back, with
:func:`~ngff_zarr.to_ome_zarr` and :func:`~ngff_zarr.from_ome_zarr`.

The same two conventions as the affine conversion apply, plus one.

Axis order
    ITK orders a vector's components fastest-axis-first, x then y then z, and
    lays the field out as ``[z][y][x][component]``. RFC-5 says the ``i``-th
    component of the field refers to the ``i``-th axis of the output
    coordinate system, so components follow ``dims``; the same permutation as
    for an affine's matrix is applied to the component axis.

Frames
    An ITK vector is a difference of two physical points. An RFC-5
    displacement is a difference of two intrinsic points, ``d = q' - q``, so
    the two differ by more than a rotation as soon as the images sit in
    different frames. Both directions follow from one identity,
    ``phi_out(q + d(q)) = phi_in(q) + v(q)``, worked out in
    :func:`_frame_terms` on top of the affine conversion's change of frame.
    The field's own grid follows ``phi_in^-1``, so its origin moves and its
    spacing does not.

Grid direction
    RFC-5 maps the field's array coordinates to the input system with the
    field's own ``coordinateTransformations``, which this package writes as a
    scale and a translation. That can only express a grid oriented like the
    input image, so a field whose direction matrix differs from the fixed
    image's (the identity when no frames are given) is refused rather than
    written with a mapping a reader would misread. Registrations sample the
    field on the fixed grid, so the common case is exact.
